# GCD: Greatest Common Divisor

## A study of The OG algorithm with modern variations

### Original Euclid Algorithm

### Imperative Style Euclid

### Imperative Style Lame

### Python3 built-in math.gcd()
Return the greatest common divisor of the integers a and b.
If either a or b is nonzero, then the absolute value of gcd(a, b)
is the largest integer that divides both a and b. gcd(a,b) has the
same sign as b if b is nonzero; otherwise it takes the sign of a.
gcd(0, 0) returns 0.

Concrete Math, Graham, Knuth, Patashnik, pp. 103:
says gcd(0,0) is undefined, i.e. gcd(0,0):return NaN

### Recursive gcd()
Code by github/endolith that demonstrates a wrapper that
does a recursive reduction on an input list:
