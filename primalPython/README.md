# Primal Python 

##### NOTE: This is an in progress personal project for my own amusement. There is one useful function in primalPython.py as I write this. Started June 2020. Anticipated completion date January 2021.

A variety of methods for calculating our favourite irrational number and related sets. Unit tests included.

As of 15-Dec-2020 I have two functions up and working with tests:
    digitalRoot() and digitalSum(). 
Next I will implement some functions for testing divisibility by certain digits

### Special thanks to:

### Usage:

It is expected that these functions are simply for learning and study. Tests can be executed by running `./test_primalPython.py` directly on the command line. Tests are built with the unittest module included with Python 3
